1.	Introduction
Like so many automobile companies in the early 1900’s, the Parry Automobile Company lasted only a short time.  The company was in business for less than 18 months.  While many companies failed due to poor quality or poor marketing, it seems that that then Parry Automobile Company was just poorly managed.   They did manage to build around 3500 cars during that time.  Of those cars, only two survive:   1910 Model 40 #228 and a 1911 Model 41 #3276.  This paper is about the Parry Automobile Company and Parry #228, owned by the author:  Michael J. and Betty Sullivan of Newbury Park, California.  Information is presented on David Parry, the founder of the Parry Automobile Company, and his family, the 1910 model year, the Parry engine, and the survivor automobile companies.  
The information in this article comes from numerous references that the author has collected over the years, including a visit to the Congressional Library in Washington, D.C., the Indiana Historical Society Library in Indianapolis, period automobile literature, and interviews with surviving members of the Parry family.
2.	David Parry 
David M. Parry was the founder and President of the Parry Automobile Company.  However, his contribution to the US automotive industry would extend beyond that.
2.1.	Biography
David Maclean Parry (Photograph #1) was the third generation of Parrys in America.  His grandfather Henry Parry was a native of Wales.  He was an engineer who settled in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.  During the War of 1812 he was under General John Cadwallader in a cannon brigade and ended up marrying the general’s daughter.  Their first child was Thomas Parry, the father of David Parry.
Thomas Parry was born in 1853 in Pittsburg and moved to Indiana to take up a life of farming. He married Lydia Maclean and had 5 children:  Edward, David, Jennie, Thomas and St Clair.  When the Thomas Parry farm was in financial trouble, it was his son David who sold his possessions and moved from New York to bail out his father; giving him his entire estate of $15,000.
David M. Parry was born on March 26, 1852.  He was raised on the family farm near Laurel, Indiana.  He started working in the hardware business at the age of 16.  He worked his way up and eventually purchased his own hardware store in New York, which he later sold to help his father in 1882.  His wife of seven years, Cora, died that same year leaving him with 2 young children.  He then returned to Indiana and purchased interest in the Woodburn Sarven Wheel Works and began making farm implements.  The business expanded quickly and he hired his brothers Thomas, St. Clair and eventually his older brother Edward.  The business had grown from 40 to 2400 employees and was renamed the Parry Manufacturing Company.  During this time he got remarried to Hessie Maxwell (no relation to the Maxwell automobile).  They had 7 children together for a total of 9.  It was said that Hessie loved and cared for all 9 children as if they were her own.  Hessie died in 1942 at the age of 87.  Hessie and David M were members of the First Baptist Church as well as other organizations such as the Elks.  The only living relative of David M. Parry that I have been able to contact is Mr. A.J. Parry of Bend, Oregon.
The Parry Manufacturing Company was best-known for their horse-drawn buggies.   They sold their buggies world-wide which increased the personal wealth and fame of David M.  He was a prominent member, and then later President, of the National Association of Manufacturers and travelled the world, sometimes with his family, promoting US products as well as Parry buggies.  One of the interesting facts about the Parry Manufacturing Company is that they initially built completely wooden-bodied buggies but later developed the metal-skin-on-wooden-frame construction that was considered lighter and stronger.  Photograph #2 shows an advertisement for one of these Parry buggies.  The Parry Manufacturing Company would turn from building buggies to automobile truck bodies, mostly for the Ford Model T and TT vehicles.  In 1919 they merged with the Martin Company to become Parry-Martin which itself was purchased and merged into the Chevrolet Division of General Motors to build truck bodies.  Some of the early Martin-Parry truck designs are credited as the first SUVs.
David M’s first experience with automobiles was reported to be one of the early backers of Henry Ford (prior to the Ford Motor Company).  Later he was involved in the Overland Automobile Company.  Parry’s interest in Overland began in 1904 when he would observe the automobile’s manufacture at the neighboring (to the Parry Manufacturing Company) former Standard Wheel Company buildings that Overland took over.  In 1906 he provided financial assistance to Overland (likely saving the company) and became President.  He was part owner and President from 1906 to 1908 when control of Overland shifted to John Willis.  In 1909 Parry sold his remaining Overland shares to Willis, who would go on to oversee the building of the successful Overland automobile.  
Parry then began plans for his own car company and incorporated the Parry Automobile Company in July of 1909.  David M. Parry continued his involvement in the National Association of Manufactures by traveling the world on behalf of US commerce.  On a trip in 1915 to Korea, Japan and Hawaii in 1915, he contracted a disease which would cause his kidneys to fail.  At the age of 63, he died on May 12, 1915 at his home at Golden Hill.  He was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery and his large monument still stands.
2.2.	Golden Hill
In 1903, while David M. was enjoying his financial success with the Parry Manufacturing Company, he purchased a large estate in northern Indianapolis.  This palatial estate was originally built by the Bates family.  It was 100 acres on the White River.  It was gated and had 16 rooms including a ballroom for entertaining.  He named the estate Golden Hill.  I have viewed a Parry family photograph that shows David M. driving a 1909 Overland at Golden Hill with his son Max, who would later become part of the Parry Automobile Company.  The family continued to live at Golden Hill after Davis M’s death but sold off surrounding land for development.  The original house still stands.
2.3.	Totem Pole
An interesting side note about David M. Parry is the story of the Golden Hill Totem Pole.  As President of the National Association of Manufacturers, Parry was involved in international commerce and met many important businessmen and politicians.  In 1904, the World’s Fair was in St. Louis, Missouri.  One of the exhibits was an Alaskan Pavilion with an Eskimo Village with 20 totem poles collected by then Alaskan Governor John Bradley for the exhibit.  While there are many rumors about why one of the totem poles was given as a gift from Governor Bradley to Mr. Parry (one rumor is that Parry was being considered as a Vice-Presidential running mate although Parry himself had denied any political aspirations), David Parry ended up with one of the totem poles.  Parry’s son Max became interested in the totem pole and had it erected on the Golden Hill property.  Years later and after the property had been subdivided, the totem pole still stood.  The ultimate disposition of the totem pole is unknown but it was believed to have fallen in 1948 due to deterioration and was discarded.  Many years later the totem pole became part of a controversy over the taking of the totem pole from Alaska and gifting it to Mr. Parry.  There have been efforts both to recreate the original totem pole in Alaska as well as in Indianapolis.
3.	The 1910 Parry Model Year
The earliest mentions in the Automotive Trade Press about the Parry Automobile Company are in The Horseless Age on July 21, 1909 and The Automobile on July 22, 1909.  In these short items it was announced that the Parry Automobile Company will be incorporated by David Parry and will be located in the former Standard Wheel Company buildings in south Indianapolis.  The company did incorporate on July 28th and announced plans to build 5000 cars the first year.  Company offices were David Parry-President, William Teasdale (Parry’s son-in-law who would become President of the Motor Car Manufacturing Company)-Vice President, Warren Oaks (son-in-law)-Treasurer and Maxwell Parry (Parry’s son)-Secretary.  (After his work at Parry Automobile, Max would learn to fly and join the air force.  He died in action during WWI in 1918 when his plane was shot down.)  The August 4th edition of The Horseless Age reports that buildings have been leased and manufacturing equipment purchased. The 1910 phone book lists the Parry Automobile Company at Standard and Division (the streets are still there as are some of the neighboring homes), The Parry Manufacturing Company at Henry and Holly (just a few blocks away) and David and Hessie Parry at Golden Hill.
In the September 1st edition of The Horseless Age there is an item that the first Parry automobiles will be available beginning October 1st of 1909.  This is consistent with advertising photographs of both a Parry roadster (Model 35) and Touring (Model 40) at the Parry Golden Hill estate where it is clearly early Fall with some trees already having lost their leaves.  (Photographs #3 and 4).  The cars in these photographs appear to be pre-production models as they have several characteristics that were not found in production vehicles.  These include a painted radiator shell and an oval radiator cap (Photograph #5).  The brass radiators would be built by the Rome-Turney Radiator Company of Rome, New York.  I would speculate that this design is a carry-over from the Overland automobiles with a similar radiator design and likely used for prototype vehicles.  This same radiator is shown in advertising photographs of the Parry chassis.  Production automobiles (like car #228) had brass radiators and round radiator neck.
The 1910 model year would focus on only two models:  the roadster and the touring.  While early advertising lists these cars by their body style, they eventually come to be named the Model 35 and Model 40, respectively, presumably for their advertised horsepower.  This is interesting since both cars were built on the same chassis.  While predicting a record-breaking 5000 unit production year with the goal of 35 cars per day, by November 1909 production had only reached 10 cars per day and 18 by February 1910.   [Note:  based on the above dates and production figures, I estimate that car #228 was built in late October or early November 1909.]  References to actual number of cars built differ.  Some references list “less than 900” while serial number records list 651 1910 vehicles built.  With the typical difficulties in early automobile production facilities, I am included to favor the lower estimate.  However, it is clear that the goal of 5000 was never reached.
An article written by Maxwell Parry provides some additional information on the 1910 model year.  He states that the “Company machines many parts such as crankcases, cylinders, tools and jigs. Motors are assembled at the shops and then set up in a prepared chassis, whereupon the tester breaks it in on the Parry Track.”  This description is consistent with a photograph of a Parry chassis begin test-driven (Photograph #6) as well as facility drawings showing a factory track (Photograph #7).  This article also describes the roadster as gray in color and the touring as blue.  [This coloring scheme is consistent with other advertising as well as the vehicles shown in photographs #3 and #4.]
The technical specifications of the 1910 Parry chassis are shown in Photograph #8.  Among the key features are:
•	4 cylinder “Parry Motor” with 4.25” bore and 4.5” stroke
•	Recycling-splash oiling system
•	High-tension magneto
•	Specially-built Schebler carburetor (while the typical Schebler for this time had a sliding accelerator valve and pipe-thread attachment, the Parry carburetor had a butterfly accelerator valve and flange attachment)
•	27” rims
•	Russian Blue body (with grey running gear and monogram panel on rear doors)
•	Leather-faced cone clutch
•	Foot brakes work internal expanding bands and emergency brakes work external contracting.

The pricing for the roadster and touring was listed as $1285 and $1485, respectively.  
By May of 1910, the Parry Automobile Company was advertising it new 1911 models.  A total of 8 different vehicle models were listed, including several variants on the touring and the roadster.  A closed-coupe was also advertised as being available by August 1, 1910.  It is unclear whether all these models were produced as I have only seen photographs of single seat (Model 25) and double seat (Model 39)  roadsters (including the 1911 Bulldog) and the 5-passenger touring (Model 42).  The company was already experiencing financial difficulties and went into receivership in December of 1910 (The Horseless Age December 7, 1910).  The company was re-organized into the Motor Car Manufacturing Company, under the leadership of W. Teasdale, the former Parry Vice President.  By January 19th of 1911 the factory was back in operation (The Automobile, January 1911).  The 1910 and 1911 Parry automobiles would be the only two model years built.  There are references to around 2500 1911 Parry automobiles being built with is consistent with the serial number of the surviving 1911 Parry Model 42 (serial number 2737, Photograph # 9).  If 650 1910 model year Parry automobiles were built and 2500 in the 1911 model year then it is likely around a total of 3000 Parry automobiles could have been built.
The February 2, 1911 edition of The Automobile has Parry automobile advertising under the new company name Motor Car Manufacturing Company.  However the car is now called the “New Parry”.  The manufacture of the New Parry is based upon the original Parry chassis and the 1911 Parry models (although the radiator now carries the New Parry badge).  Manufacture and sales of the New Parry continues through 1911.  The September 27, 1911 edition of The Horseless Age announces that both the New Parry and the Pathfinder automobiles will be built in the same manufacturing facility.  New Parry automobiles are built and advertised up to December of 1911 but limited advertising is found in 1912.  An October 27, 1911 edition of the Los Angeles Times has both New Parry and Pathfinder automobiles advertised together.  It seems that in early 1912 the Motor Car Manufacturing Company focuses on the Pathfinder automobile and eventually changes its name to the Pathfinder Automobile Manufacturer.   The last New Parry automobiles were likely built in early 1912.
Parry automobiles competed in several races.  In 1910, Parry entered the Glidden.  The car did not do well and there was significant controversy between David Parry and the Glidden organizers, including the threat of a law suit over how performance times were calculated.  The Glidden committee threatened to drop the Parry from the competition.  This threat caused David Parry to drop his objections.  A photo of the Parry in the 1910 Glidden is shown in Photograph #10.  A Parry automobile also participated in the 1910 Desert rally from Los Angeles, California to Phoenix, Arizona.  The Parry did finish but did not win.
Parry automobiles seem to have been sold across the United States and abroad.  In addition to Colorado, there were Parry Dealers in Los Angeles (Horine-Brooks Motor Car Company), New York City and Detroit (Neal-Kitchel Motor Sales Company).  The Los Angeles dealership seemed particular active as they likely sponsored the Parry in the Los Angeles to Phoenix Desert Rally as well as arranged several Los Angeles Sunday Herald articles of Parry automobiles being driven by women.  In one article Miss Catherine Brooks drives a Parry roadster and in another actresses Beulah Dalla and Estelle Wordette of the Los Angeles Theatre drive a Parry 4-passenger roadster (Model 35) over 60 miles at speeds up to 55 mph to demonstrate the quality and reliability of this automobile.  At least six 1910 Parry automobiles (2 runabouts and 3 tourings) were exported to Puerto Rico and 13 Parry automobiles were exported to Australia.  This is likely due to the international connects that David M. developed during his travels.

4.	Discussion of the Parry Engine
During the first several years during my ownership on Parry #228 I researched the automobile to determine which components were made by Parry and which were purchased.  It seems that the Parry automobile is what I would call a semi-assembled car.  Parry made the frame and front axle and the transmission along with radiator, fenders and body.  The rear axle was made by American Ball Bearing and is similar to what is in the 1909 Cadillac Model 30.  The Kurtz magneto was purchased from the Hercules Magneto Company.  
The engine is almost identical to the engine in the 1910 Buick Model 19.  Buick originally developed this 255 cubic inch (4.25” bore x 4.5” stroke), 4 cylinder, and overhead valve engine for their Model D in 1906.  The engine was upgraded and ‘modernized’ for the Model 19.  The Buick Model 19 and the Parry Model 40 are contemporary automobiles.  The similarity of the engines means that either Parry purchased an engine and copied it or they purchased the engine patterns from Buick and were licensed to manufacture and put the engine in their vehicles.  I believe that due to the timing (both cars being introduced as 1910 models around the same time in Fall 1909) it is likely that Parry purchased the engine patterns from Buick.  This is further supported by company advertising that refers to the engine as the “Parry Motor”.  In addition, the Parry advertising described the “machining of engine components” in its advertising which supports the fact that they cast and then machined their own engine components.
There are however a few differences between these two engines which are evident upon close inspection.  These differences include:
•	Intake and exhaust manifolds
•	No Buick part numbers on cast parts (e.g., cast cylinder pairs)
•	Water manifolds
•	Fan mounting bracket
•	Oil pan casting (some thicker section on the Parry oil pan to strengthen it)
•	Camshaft (Parry camshaft has an integral flange for the timing gear where the Buick timing gear is keyed to the camshaft with a tapered pin holding it on.)
•	Front engine cover (The Buick cover has a bulge due to the longer camshaft and the Parry cover is flat.)
Photos of the engine in Parry vehicle #228 are shown in Photograph #11.

5.	1910 Parry Model 40, Vehicle #228
Research on 1910 Parry Model 40 vehicle #228 suggests that it was manufactured in either late October or early November of 1909.  Vehicle #228 is the earliest and only complete Parry automobile remaining.  This vehicle remains in mostly unrestored condition with original paint and leather seats, drivetrain and top.  A photograph of this vehicle is in Photograph #12.  The history of this automobile is the following:
•	Sold new to Mr. Raymond Coots of Sterling, Colorado in 1910.  The earliest photo of the car with Mr. Coots is in the 1948 HCCA Gazette, Volume 10, No. 4, page 16. [Of interesting note is that the 1911 Parry Model 42, vehicle #2737 was also found and purchased for restoration in Colorado.  This may suggest a successful Parry dealership in Colorado.]
•	Sold to the Harrah’s Museum of Reno, Nevada at the June 10, 1960 Streeter auction in Claremore, Oklahoma
•	Sold to Mr. J. Parker Wickham of Mattituck, New York in 1983.  [Of interesting note is that Mr. Wickham had a collection of what he called “one-only” cars.  His museum contained cars of which there was only one surviving example.  Therefore, he purchased the Parry.  The remnants of his collection were sold, after his death, to the Fountainhead Museum in Anchorage, Alaska.]
•	Sold to Michael and Betty Sullivan of Newbury Park, California in December 2003.
The story of my purchase of Parry #228 in December 2003 goes back to 1993.  At that time I was looking for a 1910 or early brass car with the no front-door design.  A 1910 Parry was advertised on Massachusetts and it was listed as the “former Harrah’s Parry”.  I was planning a business trip to the east coast and decided to go see the car.  However I first went to the National Automobile museum in Reno, Nevada (the remnants of the Harrah collection) which maintains an extensive automobile literature collection.  This collection includes the documentation on each of the former Harrah’s cars.  I secured copies of their file on Parry #228 and went to see the car.  Upon inspecting the car for sale in Massachusetts I found that it was Parry #2737, not the Harrah’s #228.  I did not purchase the car but instead set upon a quest to find #228.
The quest took about 5 years when I was finally able to determine that the car was in the J. Parker Wickham collection in Mattituck, New York.  In 1999 I began corresponding with Mr. Wickham about the possibility of purchasing the car.  He was adamant that he would never sell the car and I could wait and purchase it from his estate.  In 2001, on a family vacation to New York City, I rented a car and drove out to Mattituck to meet Mr. Wickham and see the car.  Indeed this was Parry #228.  Mr. Wickham was very kind.  He pulled the car out of the museum, got it running, and gave my son Justin and I a drive on the airport runway at his home. 
At the visit I took a photo of my son Justin and I in the Parry.  I framed an 8” x 10” copy of this photo and sent it as a thank-you to Mr. Wickham with the words at the bottom:  “Michael Sullivan…future Parry owner”.  Mr. Wickham hung the photo in his office.  In late 2003 Mr. Wickham was in the process of purchasing additional automobiles for his museum and decided to donate several to the AACA museum in Hershey.  The Parry was one of the cars he intended to donate.  The photograph reminded him of my interest.  Since I had written my phone number and address on the back of the photograph (a strategy that my friend Mr. Lin Thomas taught me), he was able to contact me and offer the car.  I immediately said yes and arranged the purchase and the shipping to California.  I will always be thankful to Mr. Wickham for remembering my interest in the Parry and selling me the car.
We have been driving the car on HCCA tours since 2004.  Our goal has been to keep the car in original and unrestored condition.  Any part that needs repair (e.g., a broken front main spring in 2004) is painted grey to show that it has been repaired.  Over the years I have re-lined the brakes, put new bearings in the transmission, and most recently, rebuilt the engine.  In 2012 I decided to drive the Parry 1200 miles from Los Angeles to Colorado Springs, Colorado in celebration of the HCCA 75th anniversary.  On that trip the crankshaft broke.  I had a new crankshaft machined and re-assembled the engine using as many original parts as possible (new aluminum pistons and new valves were installed) to have the car running for the 2014 HCCA Bakersfield Tour and Swap meet where the 1910 Parry is being honored as the car of the year.  The car still has the original leather interior and top.  We will continue to drive the car as it is a great example of a (mostly) unrestored brass car.

6.	Conclusion
David Parry contributed to the early automobile industry in the United States.  Remnants of Overland, Parry, Pathfinder and Parry-Martin exist today in the modern automobile industry.  The Parry automobile, like so many other car companies that did not last, contributed to our rich automobile history.  Even though only two Parry automobiles survived, we know much of their construction and history.  They were well-built automobiles and are worthy of our attention and admiration.
Betty and I greatly enjoy participating in the brass-ear car hobby and specifically the HCCA.  We are thankful to HCCA for honoring the Parry automobile and are glad to be able to share our car and story with others.  We hope to see you on a future HCCA tour, especially the HCCA National Grizzly Bear Tour, which we plan and host, each April immediately before the HCCA Bakersfield event.
